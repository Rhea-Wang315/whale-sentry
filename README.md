# Whale-Sentry  
**On-chain Risk Detection for MEV & Trading Abuse**

Whale-Sentry is an on-chain risk detection system designed to identify suspicious trading behaviors on decentralized exchanges, with a focus on MEV-related attacks (e.g., sandwich attacks) and wash trading on Uniswap V3.

The project applies statistical modeling and lightweight machine learning as supporting tools, prioritizing data correctness, interpretability, and operational awareness over model complexity.

> 🚀 **Current Status**: Phase 1 Complete (Feb 18, 2026)  
> Core detection modules operational: Sandwich Attack (O(n log n) optimized) + Wash Trading (ROUNDTRIP pattern) with **101 passing tests**. Production-ready data pipeline from Uniswap V3 Subgraph to Parquet storage.  
> **Next**: Building interactive dashboard & attacker profiling analytics (Phase 2).

---

## Key Highlights

🚀 **Algorithm Optimization**: Sandwich detection optimized from O(n³) to O(n log n) — **45-92x speedup** on real datasets

🔍 **Explainable Detection**: Statistical signals + rule-based logic, not black-box ML — every detection is auditable

🧪 **Production-Ready**: 101 passing tests, type-safe Pydantic models, reproducible data pipeline with full validation

📊 **Real-World Validation**: Validated on 19,000+ Uniswap V3 transactions (Feb 2026 WETH/USDC pool), 3,216 sandwich attacks detected

🛠️ **CLI Tools**: Ready-to-use scripts for batch detection, data cleaning, and analysis — no code required

⚡ **Performance**: Processes 10,000+ transactions in seconds, suitable for batch analysis and research

## Motivation

Decentralized finance introduces transparency at the data level, but **not at the behavior level**.  
Malicious or exploitative trading strategies—such as sandwich attacks and wash trading—are often hidden within large volumes of legitimate transactions.

Whale-Sentry is built to answer a practical question:

> **Can we systematically detect suspicious on-chain trading behavior using statistical signals and machine learning, rather than heuristics alone?**

This project is particularly relevant for:
- DeFi protocol risk monitoring
- MEV analysis and mitigation research
- On-chain compliance, fraud detection, and market surveillance

---

## Core Focus

- **On-chain data analysis** (Uniswap V3 swaps & liquidity events)
- **MEV-aware anomaly detection**
- **Explainable risk signals**, not black-box predictions
- Research-oriented engineering with production-minded constraints

---

## Data Sources

- **Uniswap V3 Subgraph**
  - Swap events (transaction behavior)
  - Liquidity events (Mint / Burn)
- Initial scope:
  - Ethereum mainnet
  - Major liquid pools (e.g., WETH / USDC)

All data pipelines are designed to be **fully reproducible**.

---

## Detection Targets

### 1. Sandwich Attacks (MEV)
Pattern-based detection combined with anomaly scoring:
- Same-pool, short-interval transaction sequences
- Attacker address appearing before and after a victim trade
- Directional reversal consistent with price manipulation
- Abnormal price or volume impact around victim transactions

### 2. Wash Trading
Statistical detection of self-trading patterns:
- **ROUNDTRIP pattern**: Same address repeatedly buying and selling within short time windows
- **Detection parameters**: 
  - Time window: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
  - Minimum trade amount: $1,000 USD
  - Minimum round trips: 3 cycles
- **Metrics tracked**:
  - Trade count and frequency
  - Amount similarity (MAD-based)
  - Counterparty diversity
  - Time window analysis
- **Confidence scoring**: Multi-factor weighted scoring (trade count, amount similarity, counterparty diversity)

---

## Methodology

The system follows a two-layer approach:

1. **Rule-based candidate generation**
   - Interpretable, MEV-aware heuristics for high recall
2. **Statistical & ML-based scoring**
   - Robust Z-score (MAD-based)
   - Isolation Forest for anomaly ranking

This design prioritizes **explainability first**, then **model-based prioritization**.
This design explicitly avoids black-box decision making and favors signals that can be audited, reasoned about, and operationally monitored.

---

## Limitations & Known Issues

### Current Implementation
- **Block-level ordering**: Currently uses timestamps only. Real sandwich attacks occur within the same block; future versions should incorporate `txIndex` for more precise detection.
- **Profit calculation**: Uses simplified USD value difference. Production version should calculate actual profit based on `sqrtPriceX96` price impact and gas costs.
- **MEV bot filtering**: Does not distinguish between malicious sandwich attacks and legitimate arbitrage bots.

### Performance Characteristics
- **Optimized algorithm**: O(n log n) complexity, suitable for datasets up to 10,000+ transactions
- **Legacy algorithm**: O(n³) complexity, provided for reference and validation only
- **Memory usage**: Reasonable for datasets up to 100,000 transactions (< 500MB)

### Future Extensions
- Direct log-level ingestion via `web3.py`
- Real-time streaming detection
- Cross-DEX analysis (Uniswap V2, Curve, etc.)
- Integration with MEV relay / builder data
- Known MEV bot address filtering
- Multi-victim sandwich pattern detection
- Block-level transaction ordering (`txIndex`)
- Precise profit calculation using `sqrtPriceX96` and gas costs
